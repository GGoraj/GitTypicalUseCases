# Case 0.5: Cloning a repository

*Adding a second (or third or â€¦) programmer to the project*

The programmers who would like to participate in the project must be invited to the repository. (See Case 0).
To get the code from the remote repository for the first time, we clone the repository. This copies the code in the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://lasse_conrad@bitbucket.org/ChristianKirschberg/gittest.git
```
You can cut and paste the right url from Bitbucket using the following steps:
Select the Dashboard / overview pane.
Select the right repository, in our example it is ChristianKirschberg / GitTest

<a href="http://imgur.com/zxgtBkd"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zxgtBkd.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Cut and paste the url into the terminal after having written the first part of the command i.e. git clone [cut and paste url].

Verify the result of the git clone command is similar to this screen output.

After this, you have the code from the shared repository in your local repository and you can start participating in the development of the project, which will will work with in the next section.
