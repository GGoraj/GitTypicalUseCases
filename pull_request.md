# Creating a pull request from a fork
If you've forked a repository and made changes to the fork, you can ask that the upstream repository accept your changes by creating a pull request.

You can open a pull request to the upstream repository from any branch or commit in your fork. We recommend that you make changes in a topic branch, so that you can push followup commits if you receive feedback on your pull request. You also have the option to give the upstream repository's maintainers the ability to make commits on your topic branch to update your pull request. If your pull request compares your topic branch with a branch in the upstream repository as the base branch, then your topic branch is also called the compare branch of the pull request. For more information about pull request branches, including examples, see "Creating a Pull Request."
